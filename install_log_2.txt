INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of gevent to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested greenlet==1.1.0
    gevent 24.2.1 depends on greenlet>=2.0.0; platform_python_implementation == "CPython" and python_version < "3.11"

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
